# Real-Time-Bus-racking
Problem: One of the famous data scientist Travis travelled to Chicago and took Clark Street #22 bus up  to his office. Unfortunately, He lefts his suitcase on the bus. So, my task was to get that suitcase back.  Solution: Looking forward to this problem, I decided to track the bus that Travis took from the Clark Street. So, I hacked transit data from the website of Chicago Transit Authority(CTA) and tried to monitor the bus using its real-time GPS tracking. I gathered the data from the  website and parse the XML data using python and find the suspect buses by getting the ID of the bus and monitor there latitude and longitude till they reach back to Travis office.
